# Modern Green Thumb Application

This is the mobile application for iOS and Android phones. It allows you to setup each individual [tracker](https://github.com/JuanCPDev/ModernGreenThumbTracker) and add it to your account. It uses Google's Firebase Authentication services for account management. It then communicates with the [API](https://github.com/JuanCPDev/ModernGreenThumbServer) using HTTP commands to get all tracker information.
